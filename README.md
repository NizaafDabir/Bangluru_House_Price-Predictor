## üìÑ Introduction

The real estate market in Bangalore is rapidly growing, and predicting house prices is key for buyers and sellers alike. This **Bangluru House Price Predictor** uses machine learning to estimate house prices based on various features like location, square footage, and the number of bedrooms. The project includes data preprocessing, model development, and deployment via Flask.

The dataset contains various features related to house pricing in Bangalore:

- **Location**: Area where the house is located.
- **Total Square Feet**: The size of the house in square feet.
- **Number of Bedrooms (BHK)**: The number of bedrooms.
- **Number of Bathrooms**: The total number of bathrooms in the house.
- **Price**: The price of the house (target variable for prediction).

## üìë Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning** (removing duplicates, handling missing values).
2. **Feature Engineering** (encoding categorical variables, creating new features).
3. **Model Building** (training machine learning models like Linear Regression).
4. **Model Evaluation** (evaluating model performance using RMSE and R¬≤).
5. **Pickling the Model** for deployment.
6. **Web Application** using Flask for live price predictions.

## üíª Approaches Used

- **Data Preprocessing**: Involved handling missing data, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables like locations.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Models used to predict house prices:
  1. **Linear Regression**: A simple and interpretable model.
  2. **Decision Trees**: Captures complex relationships in the data.
  3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble model to improve prediction accuracy.
  
- **Evaluation**: Models were evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **R¬≤ score**.
